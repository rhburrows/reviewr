Feature: Coder Requests Code Review

  In Order to ensure code quality
  As a coder
  I want to send a review request to another member of my team

  Background:
  Given I am in the working directory of a git repository

  Scenario: Create Review Branch
    Given the last commit was "12345678123456781234567812345678"
    When I run "reviewr request reviewer@site.com"
    Then reviewr should create a new branch called "review_12345678"

  Scenario: Add a meta-data commit to the review branch
    Given my git email is "coder@site.com"
    And the last commit was "12345678123456781234567812345678"
    When I run "reviewr request reviewer@site.com"
    Then reviewr should create a commit with message:
    """
    Code Review Request
    ===================
    requested_by: coder@site.com
    requested_from: reviewer@site.com
    """
